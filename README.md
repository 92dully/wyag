# WYAG – Write Yourself a Git  

This repository is my implementation of the **“Write Yourself a Git”**, where Git is re-created from scratch in Python.  

## Purpose  

The purpose of this repo is to:  
- Improve my **Python programming experience**.  
- Build a deeper **understanding of Git internals**.  
- Gain more practical **Git usage experience**.  
- Strengthen my comfort with the **Unix terminal and shell tools**.  
- Learn by building — turning abstract concepts about Git into working code.  

## What is WYAG?  

The end result is a simplified version of Git, called **`wyag`**, that supports many of Git’s core commands:  

- `init`  
- `add`  
- `commit`  
- `log`  
- `status`  
- and more...  

All of this is written in about **1,000 lines of Python**.  

## Note  

This project is not meant to replace Git — it’s a learning project to **understand how Git works under the hood**.
